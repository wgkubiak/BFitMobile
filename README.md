## What this app is about
The main characteristic of the app is simplicity. There are two types of accounts, proteges and supervisors. On the side of the protege, there is one form including weight, glucose and pressure. After submit of data, data is send to the supervisor and protege job is done untill next day. On the side of supervisor, there is list of proteges included in his group and their latest health informations.

## Live
The first thing that shows up to the visitor is the login screen. From this level it is possible to create a user account of the selected type and to log in.

<br />

Based on the account type, two types of screen can be shown to the user.

<br />

* <b>Supervisor</b> - it allows the analysis of data of proteges. The supervisor has the ability to add new proteges to his group (those who are not already signed) and to remove them.

</p>

<br />

* <b>Protege</b> - Allows you to enter data (once a day), later analyzed by a supervisor. The main idea is "enter your data, come back tomorrow".

## How can I install this app
All you have to do is to download [release](https://github.com/wojciechkubiak/opqn-mobile/releases) of this app from my github repository. Just do consider the fact, that the application is no longer supported by me (I'm focusing on web development right now).
